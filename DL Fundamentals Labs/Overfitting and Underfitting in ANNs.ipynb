    "# Overfitting and Underfitting in ANNs\n",
    "\n",
    "For all their performance power, ANNs are not without their shortcomings. Four such issues described earlier were:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vanishing/Exploding gradients\n",
    "* Insufficient training data\n",
    "* Extremely slow training\n",
    "* Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab will cover the last of these: **overfitting**. Overfitting happens across every problem addressed by machine learning/deep learning and ANNs are no difference. Learning the methods to reduce/eliminate overfitting are important for anyone interested in developing their acumen in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "When building a model to solve a problem, the model is typically \"trained\" using historical data on the given phenomenon so that predictions can be made when new data becomes available. This is a balancing act between **model optimization** and **model generalization**. Optimization can be thought of as what's done during the training process -- evaluating several models, hyperparameter optimization, etc. On the other hand, generalization is the expectation/goal that the trained model will perform well making predictions on new, unseen data. Good generalization is the goal of building models but it isn't something that can be directly controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial training occurs using **Training Data** and then evaluated using **Test Data** which simulates data that might be passed through the model in the future. Both come from the same data set originally with observations randomly being assigned to one set or the other. When beginning to train a model and compare the predictions it makes both to the training data and testing data, at first the predictive performance will improve within both data sets. If a model's training was *stopped* very early on this would be a case of **underfitting** -- the model has not been allowed to identify all the patterns in the training data useful for the prediction task. In other words, it could do better!\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, overfitting occurs when training is allowed for too long. Eventually, the model is starting to learn patterns that are specific to the training data but might be irrelevant or misleading when using it on the test data. The goal then is to find a preverbial \"Goldilocks Zone\" for model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal solution to overfitting is to obtain more training data (which it itself is another issue with ANNs) but that isn't always possible. Two approaches outlined below, **regularization** and **dropout**, can be used when obtaining more data isn't feasible.\n",

    "is generalization, not fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the network has limited memorization resources, it will not be able to learn this mapping as easily, and thus, in \n",
    "order to minimize its loss, it will have to resort to learning compressed representations that have predictive power regarding the targets \n",
    "-- precisely the type of representations that we are interested in. At the same time, keep in mind that you should be using models that have \n",

    "Unfortunately, there is no magical formula to determine what the right number of layers is, or what the right size for each layer is. You \n",
